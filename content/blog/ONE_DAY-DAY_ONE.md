If you ever feel like giving up on your dreams, remember this: ONE DAY, DAY ONE.

My journey started right after I left my second internship. I was determined that I would be the 1st person in my circle to crack an on-campus placement. My parents had high hopes, and I was ready to make them proud. They even supported me to leave my internship early so I could focus on my placements.

Cut to 5 months later, I am still unplaced. Self-doubt is to its peak, and I am questioning my abilities. None of my efforts seemed to pay off. The last interview that I gave (read: [I Fucked Up](/blog/I_fucked_up)) had left me shattered. I felt like I had let myself and my family down.

Each and every day, felt like a battle. My spirit was crushed, to an extent that I used to cry myself to sleep. Then another opportunity came on 27th Jan: Infosys(SP role). Those who don’t know, Infosys is notorious for its tough selection process. Its OA rounds are even tougher than Amazon’s. Till day today, I am unable to digest the fact that I was one of the few selected from a pool of 4000 candidates.

I was so proud of myself, I had left pratishtha for this(its literally a once in a lifetime thing to witness). I am still waiting for the results of the next round, but this selection has rekindled my hope.

Now here comes the magical moment: The founder whom I reached out to for internship, back in october last year, messaged me out of the blue. He offered me an internship position at his startup. I was over the moon. This was so unexpected.

Its been 2 days since I joined the company and its been an incredible experience so far.The team is amazing, work is great, and I am learning so much. Everything that I worked hard for is finally seem to be falling into place.

Life humbles you in mysterious ways. I used to think, i am the most smartest in the room. and then i have seen everybody get ahead of me. It never made me jealous, but it made me introspect. I realized that I had to work harder, smarter and be more resilient.

So here I am, on day one of a new journey, all because one day I decided not to give up.
