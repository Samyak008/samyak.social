Today was the worst interview, i gave in my life. It was a chance that came to me as a silver platter, with all the perks and benefits I could have asked for. Yet, I managed to completely botch it.

I definitely had to work for it, as usual, i was not even eligible to apply for it(somebody who know's me would know the reason why). But I managed to convince the co-founder to give me a chance, and she gave. After a long time I felt validated, that someone saw potential in me.

Cut to dissapointment, I completely fucked up the interview. I was nervous, unprepared and just all over the place. The questions were so easy that even with minimal preparation I could have blasted through it. But I choked it.

I feel like such an idiot. I had this golden opportunity, and I let it slip through my fingers. I can't stop thinking about what I could have done differently.

And the things is I've become such thick-skinned person over the years that I don't even feel bad about failing interviews anymore. But this time it's different. This time I feel like I've let myself down in a big way.

I need to learn from this experience. I need to prepare better, manage my nerves, and approach interviews with the seriousness they deserve. I can't afford to let opportunities like this slip away because of my own fucking carelessness.
