        Hey there, welcome to my cyber-castle where all that I do is collated and referenced.
      </p>
      <p className="text-muted mt-3 text-lg">
        I’m a man of many muses and the polylemma of choosing one at a moment in time is a luxury I’m glad I can afford.
        I contemplate quite a lot and it's only fair I share some of those thoughts here.
      </p>
      <p className="text-muted mt-3 text-lg">
        From tech to philosophy, art to science, I dabble in a bit of everything and document my journey along the way.
        Stick around, explore, and maybe you'll find something that sparks your own curiosity.
      </p>
      <p className="text-muted mt-3 text-lg">
        All the opinions stated herein are my own and albeit my meandering casualness, do expect a liberal pinch of seriousness occasionally thrown into this epistemological potpourri that livens up this cyber-castle.
